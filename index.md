* Are your bookshelves at home lined with worn out trade paperback novels from authors like Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Agatha Christie and other great murder mystery writers?

* Do you haunt used bookstores, garage sales and eBay searching for a undiscovered story that’ll keep you up far too late tonight?

* Have you ever stepped into traffic because your nose was stuck in a book?

* Ever gotten away with murder and wondered if anyone knew?

We can help you with all but the last question because TalesofMurder.com is a site created specifically for rabid fans of murder mystery stories!

That’s right! We’ve hired the best literary detectives to search out and find old, new, forgotten, remembered, unknown and favorite murder mysteries so that you don’t have to wear the soles of your shoes flat in a desperate search for one more good story. We’ve collected the best murder mystery short stories (’cause nobody’s got time to read for hours anymore!) and we’ve serialized great novels so you can read them in bits and starts whenever ‘they’ aren’t watching.

Here’s the deal:

Every day, we’re gonna be releasing up to 3 new murder mystery short stories. One early, one around lunch and one in the evening. 

They’ll run the gamut of murder mystery genres, from hardboiled PIs to sweet, little old ladies chasing down a nefarious killer. Whatever kind of murder gives you your kicks ... we’ve got ‘em.

You’ll be able to sort by author, title, length of read, or genre (cozy, noir, police procedural ...) or just read the newest stories.

And we’ve contracted with a crew of website hitters to design and develop all of this goodness ... just for you!

They’re working day and night to put it all together and refine the great murder mystery stories our detectives have found. 

But you need to be patient just a little longer to sink your teeth into these great stories.

However ...

I can let you in on a little secret. Because you’re a REAL fan of murder mysteries--unlike those other guys &amp; dolls--you can be part of the development of this site. That’s right!

Lean in a little closer and let me explain. 

That’s it ... a little closer ... we don’t want just anybody to get in on this deal but if you click the big yellow button below, you’ll be taken to a special page for REAL murder mystery fans where we’ll tell you all about what you can get by signing up. Go on. You know you wanna click that button.
