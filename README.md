TalesofMurder
=============

site dev for TalesofMurder.com, a murder mystery short story website

## v0.1 - Prelaunch site

Version 0.1 is the initial stage of development and is the prelaunch landing page site with only a few simple pages:

1. landing page - a simple page with a basic site/branding header and copy that introduces TalesofMurder.com, explaining what the site-when launched-will have. It has a single link (in two locations, as buttons)
2. offer page - after readers click the button to proceed from the landing page, they are presented with the prelaunch offer. This offer outlines what they'll get if they sign up via the email sign up form.
3. Once readers input their email address and click "Join", they'll get a pop up that confirms they've entered everything correctly and telling them that they'll get a confirmation email soon.
4. Email - the confirmation email contains a link to double opt-in. It takes them to a confirmation/thank you page.
5. Thank you page - Thanks them for signing up; provides addtional information about policies, etc. and gives them a link to go to later. It also has whatever download links for products they get immediately for signing up.

## v0.2 - Beta site

Version 0.2 is the beta version of the full site. Once this site is basically coded, it will be hosted on a subdomain/subdirectory. A link will be sent to all prelaunch subscribers so they can check it out and comment.

## v1.0 - Full Site

Version 1.0 will be the full site, fully launched to the public. It will replace the prelaunch (v0.1) site at the TLD. It will initially be a simple site with a blog structure on the home page showing the latest stories as short teasers, with links to the full story. Comments will be open on individual stories.

The site will have basic sidebars, including:
1. email sign up for new subscribers (this will eventually grow to have various subscription levels)
2. related stories (stories by the same author and/or same category/genre)
2. ads (links to Amazon where readers can by books under the Tales of Murder imprint)
3. polls, etc.
